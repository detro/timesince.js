         * It accepts a JS Date object.
         * As weird as it sounds, the month is a number between 0 and 11.
         * Example: 17th Feb 2011 is 'new Date(2001, 01, 17)'.
         *
         * If you want to variate the format, pass a string as second parameter.
         * Acceptable values are:
         * - "%%D%%" for days
         * - "%%H%%" for hours
         * - "%%M%%" for minutes
         * - "%%S%%" for seconds
